All the STL files.

Mouthpiece03 should be scaled to 1.03 size on the X and Y axis, and left as is for Z (This is to account for shrinkage while annealing). Also print at 100% infill (To keep water from seeping in when it's being washed).

AdapterII is to be printed in a flexible filament.

Lid will print best with supports set to "everywhere", but it may print fine without depending on your printer.

Everything else is fine, just make sure the orientation is OK. If the part shows up too small, simply scale it to 10x size. (They show up too small in Cura)

Other print settings: Speed is default, infill is 45, layer height is best at 0.1MM, but for the frame, lid, and GoProMount files it can be 0.2MM.
